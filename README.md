Run 'npx xnote serve' to install and start the server then navigate to the given url address.

===========
sidenote: Pretty interesing project. React part was like the usual, Redux was a nice addition, but the whole creating of a cli, server and publishing to NPM were new and showed me how packages, that I have been using this whole time, are even created.
Also Lerna and ESBuild WASM are great.
